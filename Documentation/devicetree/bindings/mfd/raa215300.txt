* Renesas RAA215300 Power Management Integrated Circuit bindings

The RAA215300 is a high-performance, low cost 9-channel PMIC designed for 32-bit
and 64-bit MCU and MPU applications. It supports DDR3, DDR3L, DDR4, and LPDDR4
memory power requirements.
The internally compensated regulators, built-in Real Time Clock (RTC), 32kHz
crystal oscillator and coin cell battery charger provide a highly integrated,
small footprint power solution ideal for System-On-Module (SoM) applications.

The RAA215300 has six high efficiency buck regulators and three LDOs to provide
the complete system power. The internal device registers and EEPROM can be used
to configure and optimize the RAA215300 for different application requirements,
for example: power sequences, output voltages, and switching frequencies.
Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) and low power Sleep modes are supported.

Although the RAA215300 is an I2C slave that comes with an RTC device (same IP as
the ISL1208), the RTC IP is actually implemented as an I2C slave on its own with
its own I2C address, and its software support comes with a completely separated
driver. In order for the RTC to work properly, it has to be enabled via the PMIC
slave, and some RTC related features are also dealt with from the PMIC slave
(e.g. the RTC battery backup charger).

Required properties:
 - compatible		: Should be "renesas,raa215300".
 - reg			: I2C slave address.

Optional properties:
- rtc-enable			: Enables the RTC IP (which is disabled by default).
- charger-enable		: Example enable support battery charger
- charger-current-level		: Example property battery charger
- charger-termination-voltage	: Example property battery charger

Example:

	pmic: raa215300@12 {
		compatible = "renesas,raa215300";
		reg = <0x12>;

		rtc-enable;

		charger-enable;
		charger-current-level = <60>;
		charger-termination-voltage = <3000>;
	};
