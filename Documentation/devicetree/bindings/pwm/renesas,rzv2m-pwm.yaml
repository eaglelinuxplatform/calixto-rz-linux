title: Renesas RZ/V2{M, MA} PWM Timer (PWM)

description: |
  The RZ/V2{M, MA} PWM Timer (PWM) composed of 16 channels. It supports the
  following functions
  * The PWM has 24-bit counters which operate at PWM_CLK (48 MHz).
  * The frequency division ratio for internal counter operation is selectable
    as PWM_CLK divided by 1, 16, 256, or 2048.
  * The period as well as the duty cycle is adjustable.
  * The low-level and high-level order of the PWM signals can be inverted.
  * The duty cycle of the PWM signal is selectable in the range from 0 to 100%.
  * The minimum resolution is 20.83 ns.
  * Three interrupt sources: Rising and falling edges of the PWM signal and
    clearing of the counter
  * Counter operation and the bus interface are asynchronous and both can
    operate independently of the magnitude relationship of the respective
    clock periods.
