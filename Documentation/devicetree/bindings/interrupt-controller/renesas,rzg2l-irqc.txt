DT bindings for the RZ/G2L interrupt controller

Required properties:

- compatible: has to be "renesas,irqc-<soctype>", "renesas,rzg2l-irqc" as fallback.
- #interrupt-cells: has to be <2>: an interrupt index and flags, as defined in
  interrupts.txt in this directory.
  interrupt index for IRQ must started from 0, and index for NMI will follow IRQ index.
- clocks: Must contain a reference to the functional clock.
- resets: Must contain a reference to the functional clock.
- power-domains: Must contain a reference to a valid PM domain.
- interrupts: A list of interrupt-specifiers, one for each entry in
              interrupt-names.
- interrupt-names: A list of interrupt names which must be in below lists:
                   "irq0", "irq1", "irq2", "irq3", "irq4", "irq5", "irq6", "irq7", "nmi";
                   And must folow order IRQ first, then NMI.

Optional properties:

- any properties, listed in interrupts.txt, and any standard resource allocation
  properties

Example:
	intc_ex: interrupt-controller@0x110A0000 {
		compatible = "renesas,rzg2l-irqc";
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		interrupt-controller;
		reg = <0x0 0x110A0000 0 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 1 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				<GIC_SPI 2 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				<GIC_SPI 3 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				<GIC_SPI 4 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				<GIC_SPI 5 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				<GIC_SPI 6 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				<GIC_SPI 7 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				<GIC_SPI 8 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				<GIC_SPI 0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-names = "irq0", "irq1", "irq2", "irq3",
				"irq4", "irq5", "irq6", "irq7", "nmi";
		clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD R9A07G044L_IA55_CLK>;
		resets = <&cpg R9A07G044L_IA55_RESETN >;
		power-domains = <&cpg>;
	};
